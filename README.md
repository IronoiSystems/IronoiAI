# MAINSiP

MAINSiP stands for Minimalistic Artificial Intelligence and Neural Systems in Python

	**MAINSiP** is project aimed at being an educational, interactive, and simple Artificial Intelligence system.
	
 Â   **MAINSiP**'s Neural System will be utilising a simple but effective form of neural networking that will use a rule based process with adaptive learning capabilies through active stimulus and storage of data. Further information on the planned neural networking will be supplied at a later time.

	**MAINSiP**'s Artificial Intelligence will utilize a rules based system, and can be replaced/integrated with the Neural System (When the Neural System is implemented), for an Adaptive Rules Based Artificial Intelligence. The AI will be very customizable.
	
The customizations of the Artificial Intelligence include:

- Whether to use, TTS (Text to Speech), GUI, or VI (Voice Interface) for communicating with the user.
	- Planned TTS customizations include:
		- Voice Type
		- Voice Speed
		- Voice Pitch
	- Planned GUI customizations include:
		- Font Type
		- Font Formatting (Size, Bold, Italics, etc.)
		- Font Type
		- Font Color
		- UI Responsiveness (More on that later)
	- Planned VI customizations include:
		- None, as this is simply voice over
- Disabling and enabling the following prebuilt modules for your AI:
	- Music_Player
	- Simple_Calc (Addition/Subtraction and Multiplication/Division Calculator)
	- Reader
	-
