# MAINSiP
MAINSiP stands for Minimalistic Artificial Intelligence and Neural Systems in Python
    MAINSiP is project aimed at being an educational, interactive, and simple Artificial Intelligence system. 
    MAINSiP's Neural System will be utilising a simple but effective form of neural networking that will use a rule based process with learning and adaptive capabilies through active stimulus and storage of data. Further information on the planned neural networking will be supplied at a later time.
